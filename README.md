## About Project
In telecommunication data can be sent using one of many frequencies. Turns out there is 4.8 THz range of freqencies that guarantees the most stable signal with the least amount of interferances. This range is really valuable for companies so optimizing its usage is a crucial task. This app uses A* algorithm to find the optimal way to reserve space for connection between two stations. User interface is created in React and A* algorithm is implemented in python. Backend web framework is Django.

## Launching the app
To install app simply run this command while in root directory:
```bash
bash install.bash
```

To run app use:
