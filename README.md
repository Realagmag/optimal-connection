## About Project
In telecommunication data can be sent using one of many frequencies. Turns out there is 4.8 THz range of freqencies that guarantees the most stable signal with the least amount of interferences. This range is really valuable for companies so optimizing its usage is a crucial task. This app uses A* algorithm to find the optimal way to reserve space for connection between two stations. User interface is created in React and A* algorithm is implemented in Python. Backend web framework is Django.

## Launching the app
To install app simply run this command while in root directory:
```bash
bash install.bash
```

To run app use:
```bash
bash start.bash
```
## Backend modules
In `backend/pop` there are two directories:
1. pop - its files are generated by Django and are used to configure web service.
2. optimal_path:
   - `load_data.py` - file used during installation to load data from csv files into database.
   - `a_star.py` - contains solver class that has method `solve` used to find optimal path with A* algorithm.
   - `urls.py` - place where urls are mapped to functions.
   - `views.py` - endpoint functions that return HTTPResponse.
   - `models.py` - classes that represents tables from database (ORM).
   - other files are Djnago auto-generated files that have no use in program logic.

## Frontend structure
The most important file in frontend is `frontend/src/App.js` which has a function that returns React app. Other files are custom React components.
